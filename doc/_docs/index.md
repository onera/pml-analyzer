The PML analyzer is an open source API providing a simple DSL to build
a description of the architecture of your chip based on the PHYLOG Model Language (PML).
From this representation a set of safety and interference model templates can be generated to perfom safety and
interference analyses of your platform.

The only dependencies of the PML analyzer are:

+ The Java Runtime Environment version
  8 [JRE 1.8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html) or newer.
+ The Simple Build Tool [SBT](https://www.scala-sbt.org/)
