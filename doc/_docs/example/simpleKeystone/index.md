This section provides a simple yet comprehensive example of a processor PML model composed of:
* two cores,
* one DMA (Direct Access Memory),
* one Ethernet device,
* one DDR and SRAM memory,
* one SPI controller,
* an interrupt controller (MPIC),
* and a set of configuration registers reachable through a specific configuration bus.
