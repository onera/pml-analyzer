/**
  * This trait contains a library of all transactions that can occur on the platform
  * One way to define a [[pml.model.configuration.TransactionLibrary.Transaction]] or
  * a [[pml.model.configuration.TransactionLibrary.Scenario]] is to use the read/write operators specifying
  * which [[pml.model.software.Data]] is used by which [[pml.model.software.Application]].
  * For instance
  * {{{val app4_wr_input_d : Transaction = Transaction(app4 write input_d)}}}
  * defines a read transaction called '''app4_wr_input_d''' between the initiator of app4 and the input_d data.
  * The location of the application and the data are provided in the [[MySysSoftwareAllocation]] trait.
  *
  * If you want to define several paths representing a multi-transaction use the [[pml.model.configuration.TransactionLibrary.Scenario]]
  * For instance
  * {{{val app1_rd_wr_L1 : Scenario = Scenario(app1_rd_L1, app1_wr_L1)}}}
  * defines a scenario named '''app1_rd_wr_L1''' where app1 is reading and writing L1 cache
  * @note A transaction or a scenario is only '''declared''' here, it will be considered during the interference analysis if it is
  *       actually used. This is done in the [[SimpleKeystoneLibraryConfiguration]] files.
  *       A transaction should be a path from an initiator to a target, if several paths are possible a warning will be raised.
  * @see [[pml.operators.Use.Ops]] for read/write operator definitions
